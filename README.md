## ðŸ“– Usage

Hi dear user, this repo need some tweaking after cloning it right from the template

1. You need to create a secret `COMMIT_TOKEN` with the `workflow` and `repo` scopes to allow auto-formatting the code with GitHub actions
2. You need to run the `rebrand_project` just recipe, to update all the user / repo specific refs
   ```sh
   just rebrand_project
   ```
3. (OPTIONAL), you can also change the description of the `nix flake` and add the corresponding configs if your app need them
4. (OPTIONAL), delete / edit the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file
