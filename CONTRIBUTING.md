## Commit formatting

> _ðŸ’¡ NOTE: you can extend the base type provided by the conventional commit by some that comes from any other major repo that support this convention like the [angular repo](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type)_

Please follow [the conventional commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

The scopes should be set according to:

- The actions names for all the `ci` tag
- The go package name for all the code related tags (`feat`, `fix`...)
- The technology used for every other tags, for example, if the change is on the `justfile` the commit will look like. Also don't hesitate to check out how was formatted the previous commit for the files you edited

  ```text
  build(just): [COMMENT]
  ```
